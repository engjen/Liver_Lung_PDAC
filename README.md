Analysis of immunofluorescence staining to detect replication stress foci

Analysis notebook [here](https://github.com/engjen/Liver_Lung_PDAC/blob/main/20221025_PDAC_pipeline_Link.ipynb) used to:

1. Detect nuclear foci of replication stress markers pRPA, gH2AX and RAD51.
2. Calculate mean foci per epithelial cell in primary PDAC tumors and link to organotropism (i.e. liver or lung metastasis)

Image data and large files to run the first part of the code can be found [here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn51068471).
